                A physician who specializes in the treatment of the whole person through prevention and treatment based on medical evidence. Integrative medicine considers all factors that influence health, wellness, and disease - including mind, body, and spirit. Conventional and alternative methods are used to facilitate the body's innate healing response. Appropriate consideration is given to use of less-invasive and less-harmful interventions, when possible. It also incorporates all appropriate therapeutic approaches, health care modalities, and disciplines to achieve optimal health and healing.</
