                Occupational therapy assistants provide environmental modifications under the supervision of an occupational therapist.  OTAs develop and implement an individualized occupational therapy environmental modification plan that reflects the relevant contexts of the client and relevant others and maximizes current and future occupational performance, safety, and participation of the client. Clients receive environmental modification recommendations and interventions that enable them to meet occupational performance and participation goals and that have adequate flexibility to accommodate for their future needs.</
