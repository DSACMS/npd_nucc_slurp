                The Defense Health Program or U.S. Coast Guard funded &quot;fixed&quot; facilities or distinct parts of a facility, providing outpatient medical and dental services, primarily for Uniformed Services beneficiaries.  A &quot;fixed&quot; facility is a non-temporary, non-deployed facility.  It includes mobile specialty units such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) units that may furnish services at the &quot;fixed&quot; facility.  It includes, as examples, the institutional portion of outpatient encounters (except Ambulatory Procedure Visits), supplies issued (e.g., glasses, ostomy supplies, crutches), and radiology and laboratory studies.  Does not include items issued directly to a patient from an outpatient pharmacy or patient transport.</
