                A pathologist deals with the causes and nature of disease and contributes to diagnosis, prognosis and treatment through knowledge gained by the laboratory application of the biologic, chemical and physical sciences. A pathologist uses information gathered from the microscopic examination of tissue specimens, cells and body fluids, and from clinical laboratory tests on body fluids and secretions for the diagnosis, exclusion and monitoring of disease.</

<p>Board certification for Medical Doctors (MDs) is provided by the American Board of Pathology (note: this taxonomy code identifies the &quot;anatomic pathology only&quot; route). To acknowledge the diverse activities in the practice of pathology and to accommodate the interests of individuals wanting to enter the field, the ABP offers primary certification through the following three routes: combined anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, anatomic pathology only and clinical pathology only. Primary certification in anatomic pathology or clinical pathology may be combined with some of the subspecialty certifications.</
