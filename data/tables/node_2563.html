                A laboratory that operates independently of a hospital and physician's office to furnish physiological diagnostic services (e.g. EEG's , EKG's, scans, etc.). Facilities offering ONLY physiological services are not certified as independent laboratories. If an independent laboratory offers physiological services IN ADDITION to clinical laboratory services, they are surveyed only for compliance with the clinical laboratory regulations because there are no health and safety regulations for physiological services.</
