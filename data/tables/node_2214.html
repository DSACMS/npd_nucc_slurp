                Respiratory emergencies are commonplace in the treatment of critical care patients.  Included in the assessment measurements conducted by the respiratory therapist in the critical care settings are arterial blood gas puncture and analysis, intrarterial monitoring, bedside measurements of lung mechanics, hemodynamic monitoring, and inspired and expired gas measurements.  This is coupled with the initiation and management of mechanical ventilation patients.</
