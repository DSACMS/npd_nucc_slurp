                Live in facilities where patients or clients, who because of their physical, mental, or emotional condition, are not able to live independently, and who receive treatment appropriate to their particular needs in a less restrictive environment than an inpatient facility. For example, an RTC may provide educational training and therapy for children with emotional disturbances or continuing care and therapy for people with severe mental handicaps.</
