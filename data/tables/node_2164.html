                A cytopathologist is an anatomic pathologist trained in the diagnosis of human disease by means of the study of cells obtained from body secretions and fluids, by scraping, washing, or sponging the surface of a lesion, or by the aspiration of a tumor mass or body organ with a fine needle.  A major aspect of a cytopathologist's practice is the interpretation of Papanicolaou-stained smears of cells from the female reproductive systems, the &quot;Pap&quot; test.  However, the cytopathologist's expertise is applied to the diagnosis of cells from all systems and areas of the body.  He/she is a consultant to all medical specialists.</
