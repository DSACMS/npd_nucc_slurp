                A distinct part of a general acute care hospital. The distinctness of a unit is determined by characteristics such as the following: the unit has admission and discharge records that are separately identified from those of the hospital; the hospital has policies specifying that necessary clinical information is transferred to the unit when a patient of the hospital is transferred to the unit; the hospital's utilization review plan includes separate standards for the type of care offered in the unit; the beds assigned to the unit are physically separate from beds not included in the unit; the unit is treated as a separate cost center for cost reporting, funding and apportionment purposes.</
