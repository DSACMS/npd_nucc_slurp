                Prevention Professionals work in programs aimed to address specific patient needs, such as suicide prevention, violence prevention, alcohol avoidance, drug avoidance, and tobacco prevention.   The goal of the program is to reduce the risk of relapse, injury, or re-injury of the patient.  Prevention Professionals work in a variety of settings and provide appropriate case management, mediation, referral, and mentorship services.  Individuals complete prevention professionals training for the population of patients with whom they work.</
