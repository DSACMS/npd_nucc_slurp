                An Independent Duty Medical Technician (IDMT) is specially trained and educated to perform primary medical care, minor surgical services, and treatment of dental disorders for active duty military members in a variety of health care and non-health care settings worldwide under direct and indirect physician supervision.  An IDMT may take medical histories, perform physical exams, order lab tests and x-rays, prescribe medications, and give immunizations. IDMTs work under the direct supervision of a physician preceptor when at home station and indirectly when assigned to a Mobile Aid Station, Mobile Medical Unit, remote site, or otherwise deployed specifically as an IDMT.  An IDMT may be an experienced Aerospace Medical Service Technician who meets special task qualifications and is recommended for training by the Aerospace Medical Service Functional Manager at their Medical Treatment Facility.  IDMTs maintain certification as Nationally Registered Emergency Medical Technicians and as Immunization Back-up Technicians.</
