                Chiropractic Neurology is defined as the field of functional neurology that engages the internal - and external environment of the individual in a structured and targeted approach to affect positive changes in the nervous system and consequently the physiology and behavior of an individual. Chiropractic Neurologists are board-certified specialists in non-drug, non-surgical care for those with neurologically based health problems. There are many conditions people suffer from that are in this broad category: learning and attention disorders, headaches, vertigo, pain syndromes, developmental disorders, nerve injury, spinal cord injury, head injury or stroke, movement disorders, and many other conditions.</
