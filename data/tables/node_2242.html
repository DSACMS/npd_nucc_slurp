                Occupational therapists enable children and adults with visual impairment to engage in their chosen daily living activities safely and as independently as possible.  This is accomplished by 1) teaching the person to use their remaining vision as efficiently as possible to complete activities; (2) modifying activities so that they can be completed with less vision; (3) training the person in use of adaptive equipment to compensate for vision loss, including high and low technology assistive devices; and (4) modifying the person's environment.</
