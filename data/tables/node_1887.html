                Advanced practice midwifery encompasses the independent provision of care during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period; sexual and reproductive health; gynecologic health; and family planning services, including preconception care. Midwives also provide primary care for individuals from adolescence throughout the lifespan as well as care for the healthy newborn during the first 28 days of life. Midwives provide initial and ongoing comprehensive assessment, diagnosis, and treatment. Midwifery care includes health promotion, disease prevention, risk assessment and management, and individualized wellness education and counseling.</
