                Pain Medicine is a primary medical specialty based on a distinct body of knowledge and a well-defined scope of clinical practice that is founded on science, research and education.  It is concerned with the study of pain, the prevention of pain, and the evaluation, treatment, and rehabilitation of persons in pain.  A comprehensive evaluation incorporates the physical, psychological, cognitive and socio-cultural contributions to pain.  The treatment protocol may include pharmacological, invasive, behavioral, cognitive, rehabilitative and complementary strategies provided in a concurrent focused and patient specific manner.  The pain medicine physician often serves the patient as a frontline physician regarding their pain, but also may serve as a consultant to other physicians, direct an interdisciplinary/multidisciplinary treatment team, conduct research, or advocate for the patient's pain care with public and private agencies.  The Pain Medicine physician may work in variety of settings including office, clinic, hospital, university, or governmental/public agencies.</
