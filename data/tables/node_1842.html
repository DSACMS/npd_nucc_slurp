                Reflexologists perform a non-invasive complementary modality involving thumb and finger techniques to apply alternating pressure to the reflexes within the reflex maps of the body located on the feet, hands, and outer ears. Reflexologists apply pressure to specific areas (feet, hands, and ears) to promote a response from an area far removed from the tissue stimulated via the nervous system and acupuncture meridians. Reflexologists are recommended to complete a minimum of 200 hours of education, typically including anatomy &amp; physiology, Reflexology theory, body systems, zones, meridians &amp; relaxation response, ethics, business standards, and supervised practicum.</

The physical act of applying specific pressures using thumb, finger and hand techniques result in stress reduction which causes a physiological change in the body. Reflexology is a non-invasive, complementary modality involving thumb and finger techniques to apply alternating pressure to reflexes shown on reflex maps of the body located on the feet, hands, and outer ears.
