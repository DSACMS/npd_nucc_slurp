                Occupational therapy assistants contribute to the completion of an individualized occupational therapy low-vision evaluation under the direction and supervision of the occupational therapist to identify factors that may facilitate, compensate for, or inhibit use of vision in occupational performance.  Clients are engaged in the identification of strengths, limitations, and goals as they relate to low vision to optimize independence and participation in desired occupations.  Occupational therapy assistants also contribute to the development and implementation of an individualized occupational therapy low-vision intervention plan in collaboration with the occupational therapist, client, and relevant others that reflects the client's priorities for occupational performance.</
