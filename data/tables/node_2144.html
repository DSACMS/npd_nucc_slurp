                The medical subspecialty of Neurocritical Care is devoted to the comprehensive, multisystem care of the critically-ill neurological patient. Like other intensivists, the neurointensivist generally assumes the primary role for coordinating the care of his or her patients in the ICU, both the neurological and medical management of the patient.  They may also provide consultative services for these patients as requested within the health system.</
